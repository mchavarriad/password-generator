# pass-generator

Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a “git init” there is technically nothing there...

## Install

```npm
npm install -g pass-gen-mcd
```

# Usage

```bash
pass-gen
```

# Contributing
If someone wants to add or improve something, I invite you to collaborate directly in this repository: [pass-gen](https://github.com/mchavarriad/password-generator.git)
